<p>This is the webserver version of a python script that is a lot more complex and customisable, such as
    running multiple analyses changing on parameter or running a single button and getting the verbose
    description of the battle. For technical reasons, the simulations are limited to 1,000 battles
    (encounters) and no custom spells are allowed as spells are encoded as method references which might
    lead to vulnerability.</p>
