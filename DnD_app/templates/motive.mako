<p>D&D is an amazing game, but encounters can get tedious when they are not a challenge. Conversely, too
    much of a challenge leads to a dissapointing series of GM fiats or, worse, a total party kill, a
    scenario to avoid as it is disappointing for all or worse. Therefore a correct balance is needed. As
    a result the GM guide has a table that can be used to calculate how hard an encounter is, which is
    not overly accurate. I have been in too many encounters that on paper should have been deadly, while
    on the table have been a walk in the park. The reason for this is that a single value cannot
    represent the strength of a party.</p>

    weapons</a>, I wrote a <a href="#links">python script</a> to simulate battles.</p>
