## Update
> This is the old server. It is no longer hosted on Openshift, but on a home server. The new server is combined with other things and actually used bootstrap material design and not BS3. The files in `.mako` format —not Chameleon— are in [mako templates](mako templates).
Unfortunately, the home server is a private repo.

## Webserver
This is the webserver files for the D&D encounter simulator. It is hosted on openshift [where you set your team to battle dragons and tarrasques](dnd.matteoferla.com).
It actually was my first go with Pyramid on Openshift. I used someone else's framework —which I do not have listed, so I cannot credit— and it is very messy.

If you were looking for the python module to similate locally all the encounters you fancy, then you need to check out the [DnD encounter similator  GitHub repository](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-battler).
